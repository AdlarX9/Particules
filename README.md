# Particles

This project features a simple and intuitive particle simulation. \
The CSS is fully customizable and does not impact the simulation's behavior. \
You are encouraged to experiment by adjusting the commented variables in the JavaScript file to observe their effects. \
Some behaviors may even resemble real physical phenomena, such as gas expansion and cooling.

You can view the simulation live at [`https://particules.pifpafdeluxe.fr/`](https://particules.pifpafdeluxe.fr/).

Hereâ€™s a quick preview:
